# Goo Search for Books!!

Goo Search for Books is a Google Books app that allows you to search for a book by title. You can save it as a reminder to buy or read later. Once you've searched for a book, it will show 10 books with either, the same title, or have something similar in the title. After that you can click the button to save it!
